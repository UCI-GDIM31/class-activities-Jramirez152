I managed to get familiar with basic Unity fundamentals. I learned to manipulate game objects and navigate the UI of unity itself. 
I also learned how to set up future builds for release on Itch.io. 
The resulting product is a cat on a new start platform, the cat game object can now move, with an increased turning speed. And finally, the camera has been shifted into the first person perspective.
